# Finhaven Smart Contracts

Finhaven tokens and other [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) smart contracts

We are using the [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/) / toolchain.

> npm install
```

## Testing

## Compiling

However, if you change smart contracts, you will need to recompile them. You can do this with

```shell
> truffle compile
> truffle migrate
```
